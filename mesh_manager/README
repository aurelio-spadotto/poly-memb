NOTES ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF BREAK_MESH

>>> based on a function cut_elem, which receives an element as a list of points, the interface, and the index of the
incoming interface edge

>>> if intface edges are short, a loop is triggered to create a chain of intface edges forming the cut

    >>> in this case, a chain of new points to be added to the final list of points is created,
        but the first and last one (the intersections), may already be in the list of points, so
        this is why a function check_and_add_new_points is there. However, if an internal point of the
        cut and an intersection are very close, a cryterion to check if a point is there cannot be based on
        distance of 2 points
