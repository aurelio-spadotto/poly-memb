Workflow Organization:

- on branch main commit changes in the python library, and in docs/. Important: docs/ is only there to generate the documentation, commit changes only if you want to change the configuration fo the documentation, and always run a make clean to avoid committing files generated by doc compilation

- on branch gh-pages only the documentation in format html is present. The documentation is deployed by github-pages. Never commit directly to the branch.
A github action is configured to update automatically the online version of the documentation whenever a modification is made, so that it is not necessary to touch the branch. When you have generated the doc
